# rainbow

Rainbow is a tool which parses various files (ZX spectrum ROM dissasemblies, ZX Spectrum Next documentation) to produce a JSON document which contains all useful information held inside those files.

The JSON can then be used to generate other files such a C headers, assembly include files and documentation easily and in a format desired by the user.

Please see the rainbow python script for details of any files required and where to store them.
